CONTAINER INSPECTION - CARGO VERIFICATION - VESSEL SURVEY
Cargo inspectors and/or surveyors examine cargo description from shipping documents and select containers or vessels, ships to inspect, before delivery. These inspectors or surveyors then ensure that the cargo matches the description in the documentation as such specification of cargoes. When wrongly rated cargoes/containers or vessels, ships are identify and found in unsuitable condition and different from/to indented use, the consultancies of inspectors and surveyors to concerning parties to implement Corrective Actions amount and hold the containers, vessels or ships  until the correct corrective actions implemented appropriately. This service helps provide a level playing field for all customers. An executive from a major ocean carrier remarked that "cargo inspection services are worth to saves the trade millions of dollars"
CARGO MEASUREMENT
Cargo Inspectors and surveyors measure cargoes for accurate dimensions (specifications about raw material, packaging, cargoes). The aim is to provide a neutral measurement result that all concerning parties can agree on. These inspectors usually sampling of cargoes to test quality and items at a standard laboratory before the vessel loads, unloads and report the results to the carrier for their follow-up.
CARGO QUALITY CONTROL AT DESTINATION
Cargo Quality Control plays a more important role which may not be discharged if there is any damage, or import control on your  suppliers. Our inspectors would assure that the quality and count ordered by you is arriving safely in the port of discharge. After approval is received by local authorities we would open your vessel, container, check its contents for quantity, size and quality, and if everything is in line with your order the container will be released to the final destination. If your suppliers did not follow your instructions we would hold the container pending your further instructions.
